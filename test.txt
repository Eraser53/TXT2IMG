A 1 Hz(10 tick clock) 8-bit Redstone CPU was designed and is being worked on by me. I took the name carbon from the actual element ?? 4 stages pipelined with 8 IO ports, 7 general purpose registers, 32 bytes of ram, 32 bytes of iCache, and ALU that can do all functions. Carbon comes with a barrel shifter as well designed by Qsmally. Carbon has 26 instructions, 7 conditions, and 3 flags(0, COUT, MSB). Forgot to mention that Carbon is insanely compact, it is 108 blocks in length, and 4JUdGzvrMFDWrUUwY36EkRHLyviZMtSjodB4gByQJwyYxPmBE1xxRL2gjkNrSqtCoRUrEDAgRwsQvVCjZbRyFTLRNyDmT1a1boZVEngineers) Which is where I am working on Carbon, I just wanted to share my little project with another Redstone community that is here. I made a teaser video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00HOfP0ywn4

Here's the dataloop
Image
Carbon is a pure harvard architectural design
acc based (Accumulator based)
Red: Instruction decoders
Green: Immediate bus that saves into registers
Image
Yellow: 8 IO ports which their logic is done (Acknowledge and Request)
Purple: 32 bytes of ram connected to the bus of the ACC.
Image
Blue: PROM(Program ROM) 32 bytes which send in serial hex to the icache
Black: Icache(Instruction Cache) 32 bytes which receives serial hex from the prom and decodes it with a hex to binary decoder by Qsmally and gets saved into the cache.

right now I'm working on LDI (Load Immediate) which is just pipelining it, it also has to disable every instruction while the immediate is loading in execute stage, then it can finally save in writeback in registers. This is probably the hardest instruction yet.
I have 5 stages in mind while building CPUs
stage 1: building all components + pipelining their inputs and outputs to other components and busses
stage 2: wiring all of the instructions to the components / control wires
stage 3: pipelining stage 2 and some other stuff
stage 4: running and debugging
stage 5: publishing
For Carbon, I am now on stage 3
Stage 3:

These are my 25 instructions in carbon
okay back to work

ok so LDI is being a pain in the ass so im gonna save it for later

What does your ram design look like 32 bytes is a good amount!!

yuh
ok so update
MLD (Memory Load) Which loads from ram and saves to the accumulator
will stall for a couple of ticks
due to some speed issues

so far MLD is done
